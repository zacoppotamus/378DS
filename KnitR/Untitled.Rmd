##Cost of Medical Care
Medical care in the United States cost Americans an average of approximately 8,500 per person per year, the equivalent of 18% of US GDP annually.  This is by far the most of any country in the world, both as a dollar ammount and as a percentage of GDP.  Most of this cost comes from emergency medical care and scheduled care at hospital facilities.

##RProject
Although our health care purchases are arguably the most important ones we will make as consumers, there is remarkably little information on how much different medical procedures cost and what we are receiving in exchange for our money.  Supposedly higher quality of care is more expensive, but is this actually true?  We used R and Tableau to explore these disparities in the cost of care and their relationship to care quality.

##Queries 
We ran these querries to Import Data into R from the ds_medicare database.
```{r}

```

##Hospital Procedure Costs

##Health Care Costs: Closer to Home
Even in Austin, there is a wide disparity in the cost of care, shown here for both insured and uninsured patients and by procedure:

##Case Study: Depression
In our research, we wanted to identify factors with high correlation to the existence of depression or other mental health disorders.

###Dataset
The dataset which was used included answers from a phone survey that took place in 2011-2012. Most questions related to behaviors resulting in leading causes of premature mortality and morbidity among adults. Over 139.000 responses were collected to 177 such questions. 

##Selected Attributes
18 attributes were chosen and extracted from the dataset as the basis of our examination in order to determine which factors have the highest correlation to mental disorders or depression. After all null values were eliminated from our selection, we had a remaining 108.544 rows.

| Attribute  | Meaning |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ADDEPEV2  | Ever told you had a depressive disorder?  |
| AGE  | Age  |
| EDUCAG  | Level of education (1-4)  |
| EMPLOY  | Employment Status (1-5)  |
| EXERANY1  | Exercise in past 30 days |
| GENHLTH  | Would you say that in general your health is? (1-5; Excellent-Poor)  |
| HLTHPLN1  | Do you have any kind of health coverage?  |
| INCOME2  | Income Level (1-8) |
| INCOMG  | Computed Income Categories (1-5) |
| MEDCOST  | Was there a time in the past 12 months, when you could not see a doctor because of the cost?  |
| RFBING5  | Binge Drinking Calculated Variable  |
| RFBMI5  | Overweight or obese calculated variable (BMI > 25.0)  |
| RFDRHV4  | Heavy Alcohol Consumption Calculated Variable  |
| RFHLTH  | Adults with good or better health  |
| RFSMOK3  | Adults who are currently smokers  |
| SEX  | Sex  |
| VETERAN3  | Are you a veteran? |

####NMF Feature Build Coefficients
Each feature created by NMF is a linear combination of the original attribute set. Each 
feature has a set of coefficients, which are a measure of the weight of each attribute on 
the feature. There is a separate coefficient for each numerical attribute and for each 
distinct value of each categorical attribute. The coefficients are all non-negative.
